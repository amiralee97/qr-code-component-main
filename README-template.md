## My process

Initial I wanted to use bootstrap because I already knew how to make card's that way. Then when I couldn't get the corners to round on the image I decided to start over with a different approach. I changed all the HTML and put everything in a container and went from there. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned that when using Boostrap you can't make the border-radius any steeper than the pre-set. I learned how to keep the footer where it belongs regardless of the content's height. 


### Continued development

I am going to continute working on mobile-first workflow and flexbox.
